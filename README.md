## Introduction
This project is a project done in the COMP2050 course. \
The project is about creating a **minimax/negamax chess agent** which can play chess reliably.

## Details
Settings can be changed in the file settings.py. The maximum depth can be reduced by changing the maximum depth in the file if your machine cannot handle a depth too high.
Normally, the agent can handle a depth of 3 fast, a depth of 4 in reasonable time, a depth of 5 in under 5 minutes and a depth of 6 and above are still very time-consuming.

## TODO
Implement move_ordering functions in ultility_function.py, which takes chess.Board object as parameter and return the sorted 
list of moves
