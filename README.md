## Introduction
This project is a project done in the COMP2050 course. \
The project is about creating a **minimax/negamax chess agent** which can play chess reliably.

## Details
Settings can be changed in the file settings.py. The maximum depth can be reduced by changing the maximum depth in the file if your machine cannot handle a depth too high. \
Normally, the agent can handle a depth of 4 fast, a depth of 5 in reasonable time, a depth of 6 in under 5 minutes and a depth of 7 and above are still very time-consuming.

## Description
A game with the improved agent is built. Run __main__.py to run the agent and test against yourself. Beware that after taking a move, you will need to wait for some time for the agent to complete its action.

You can find the class for the agent in the file agent_improved.py and agent_old.py. Settings can be changed in the file settings.py
